# Altrac Frontend Developer Test 

## Overview

A small exercise to determine if you have some basic JavaScript, React and data manipulation skills as well as an understanding of how to deploy JS websites.

The goal is to build a one-page site that loads and displays [Evapotranspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evapotranspiration) data from a weather station through our API and chart it in [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/).

You can present this in any way you like, with the following conditions:

- The site must load live data from our API. It should show at least 3 days of data
- The website must be deployed to AWS S3 (if it is not deployed there, it will encounter CORS issues)
- You must use HighCharts for charting
- You must use the React library for building the user interface

## Example

Below is a very simple chart I mocked up using HighCharts and deployed to S3. It shows Evapotranspiration in inches as well as temperature and solar data.

## Details

The API request can be made with the following URL: https://stage.altrac-api.com/evapo/address/26002e000c51343334363138?date=2020-07-27&tzOffset=-7&elevation=160.9&latitude=43.2624613&Kc=0.51

- stage = Our production API does not allow for CORS requests
- 26002e000c51343334363138 = ID of device
- 2020-07-27 = Date of requested data
- -7 = time zone offset
- 160.9 = elevation of weather station in meters
- 43.2624613 = latitude of weather station
- 0.51 = Evapotranspiration coefficient

## Assessment

Once completed, please email us a link to both the deployed site and fork of this repo showing your code. We will review it with the following in mind:

- Does the website load?
- Is the website using React? Does the React code make sense?
- Are there instruction on how to run or deploy the code?

If for some reason you cannot deploy to S3, this won't necessarily disqualify you, but you should provide a reason.

Some extra credit (but please don't spend much time on this):

- Website is bundled via webpack, and there is a webpack configuration file that runs and generates bundled code
- The website has some live controls that work without page reload. Some ideas:
   - Ability to change date range and reload data
   - Change from metric to standard units
   - Change the Evapotranspiration coefficient
- Display chart data in a simple table
